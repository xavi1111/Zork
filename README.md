# Stellar
 
Hello my name is Xavier Llubes Cano and I am the author of this project. The approach i took with this game was that of a survival horror game, the player cannot be in the same room that the monster is, if that happens the player dies. The idea is to scare the monster away with different tools and solving puzzles along the way. The game only finishes once the player is dead or the player has beaten the monster. To do so you must carefully explore stellar the spaceship where the game happens. One important thing is that the inventory only has 2 spaces and you can only use items in your inventory (the backpack does not count as inventory), so you mus manage your inventory.

This project was challenging in many ways but the most important one was because i had never previously worked with c++ so the first days I was kind of lost. As the days passed I grew accostumed to the new enviroment and got the hang of it. That does not mean that i have a lot to learn still.

# Guide on how to beat the game

In this section I will specify the most optimal order of actions to beat the game : 
- Get the lighter
 - Get the fireworks
 - Scare the alien
 - Get the wrench
 - Open the vent with the wrench
 - Talk to the robot
 - Get the backpack to carry more than 2 items
 - Get the egg
 - Get the keycard
 - Place the egg in the garbage room
 - Open the door with the keycard
 - Interact with the room
 - Enter the correct password (2309)
 
 Once the egg is placed the alien goes to the garbage room if you scare the alien it will return to the nest to bring the alien back pick the egg again and drop it again.
